    "Ordinal Encoding is used when there is an inherent order or ranking among the categories of a categorical variable.\n",

    "It is appropriate when there is a clear order, but the specific numerical differences between the categories may not hold any particular meaning.\n",
    "Example: Consider a variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" and \"Master's Degree.\" Ordinal Encoding can be\n",
    "applied to assign numerical labels like 1, 2, and 3, respectively, based on their ascending order of educational attainment.\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding is used when there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories of a categorical variable.\n",
    "It assigns unique numerical labels to each category, without considering their order or relationship.\n",
    "The assigned numerical labels are arbitrary integers that act as identifiers for each category.\n",
    "It is suitable when the categorical variable does not have a meaningful order and treating it as nominal data is sufficient.\n",

    "like 1, 2, and 3, respectively, without implying any specific order or relationship between the cities.\n",
    "In summary, Ordinal Encoding is used when there is an ordinal relationship among the categories, and preserving that order is important. Label \n",
    "Encoding is used when there is no inherent order among the categories, and treating them as nominal data is sufficient. The choice between the two \n",

It helps us understand whether the variables tend to move together or in opposite directions. Here are a few key points highlighting the importance of covariance:\n",
    "Relationship Assessment: Covariance helps in assessing the nature of the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction (i.e., when one increases, the other tends to increase as well), while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship (i.e., when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease).\n",

    "Variable Selection: Covariance is used to analyze the dependence between variables and identify important predictors. If two variables have a high positive covariance, it suggests that they are likely to have a strong positive relationship, making them potentially useful for predicting each other.\n",

Assets with low covariance can potentially reduce the overall risk of the portfolio by offsetting the movements of other assets.\n",
